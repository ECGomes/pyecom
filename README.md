# PyECOM: Python Energy Communities

## Abstract
PyECOM: Python Energy Communities, is a tool designed to facilitate the
research into Energy Communities (EC) through the ability to create, sim-
ulate and test various EC settings. Implementations of base aspects of EC
functioning are implemented and provide a flexible basis for the integration
of new components. Optimization algorithms from libraries such as Pymoo
can be accessed and are facilitated through the use of a decoder that can fur-
ther be extended. In future versions, PyECOM will also feature Reinforcement
Learning as a method available to the users.

## Installation

The required packages can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

An example usage of PyECOM can be found in the notebook
[pyecom_benchmark_example.ipynb](pyecom_benchmark_example.ipynb).
